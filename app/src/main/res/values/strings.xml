    <string name="prediction_low_pressure">Rapid and large changes in atmospheric pressure negatively affect fish activity and willingness to bite the lure. This is especially the case when the air pressure drops sharply</string>
    <string name="prediction_steady_pressure">Slow, small changes in atmospheric pressure or steady atmospheric pressure is better for the fisherman than rapid changes. At a steady atmospheric pressure, the fish seem to be lively and bite the lure more easily.</string>
    <string name="prediction_clear_sky">When the weather is clear the fish is careful, sensitive and on alert. In this case, the fisherman must be particularly quiet and careful.</string>
    <string name="prediction_cloudiness">Cloudiness affects lighting in the water and the ability of the fish to see. Fish are not as sensitive in cloudy weather as in clear.</string>
    <string name="prediction_nightfall">At dusk, the fish often leave their permanent whereabouts and move to another location. Predatory fish then move to lower water to prey. In this case, the fish are also sensitive, so fish carefully.</string>
    <string name="prediction_rain_normal">A moderate rain often makes fish lively, especially when the rain cools the warm surface water. Rain also removes shadows, so the fish will not notice the fisherman from the shore as well as in sunny weather.</string>
    <string name="prediction_rain_heavy">Heavy rain will slow down the activity of the fish for a while. Rain also lowers the water temperature. Fish are quite sensitive to temperature fluctuations, which is why rain messes the feeding rhythm of fish.</string>
    <string name="prediction_water_temp">Different fish species have their own water temperatures where they thrive best. When the temperature is favorable, they are active, eat more and grow faster, and bite the lure more easily. Some fish tolerate both cold and warm water. Such fish are at least perch, pike and burbot.</string>
    <string name="prediction_wind_normal">On a windy weather, the fish see worse than in the calm, when the fish are sensitive. Fish are often on the windward shore, where there is more food and oxygen.</string>
